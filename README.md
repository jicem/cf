Century Fighters

“Time will tear them apart”

Century Fighters is an exquisite new 2D fighting game made by Last Minute Productions. This game was developed with an original story and original concepts. The game pits 3 completely different factions of warriors against each other in an all out war for survival.

Century Fighters features a traditional arcade style fighting experience with a fresh variety of weapon types and original characters. 

The game will include a simple combat system based off of a three button controller/keyboard and will showcase a heavy/power attack, a light attack and  a jumping mechanic that will allow for an air attack.

Characters in their individual factions will have their own buff that will give them an advantage or give their opponent a disadvantage depending on the time left in the battle, the amount of health of the character, or the damage that is dealt out.
